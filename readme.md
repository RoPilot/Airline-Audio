# Welcome to Airline Audio.

**Thanks for checking out, "Airline-Audio" by RoPilot15.**


# What it does.

Airline Audio solves the problem of playing specific Airlines Announcements during a simulated flight.
This desktop application allows you to add multiple different sounds, songs and other audios to a specific airline, and play it with ease of use.

## Create files and folders.

When downloaded this app, you should have:
"main.exe"
"Audio"
"settings.txt"

## How to use.

- Place .mp3 files (10 maximum) inside a folder of your airline, which is inside the "Audio" folder.
- Type your airline name into the text box, and press "SELECT" --> This loads your audios.
- Play each audio by clicking the name of the audio file.
- Pause each song using the "PLAYING" or "PAUSED" button.
- Change the volume using the provided horizontal slider.

## Limitations

- Maximum 10 audios per file (or crashes)
- Must have Python 3.10.9 (Microsoft Store)
- Must have pygame (Command Prompt -> "pip install pygame" or "pip3 install pygame")

## Notices

- This is V1.0 of this application. Updates are scheduled, and can be requested through the GitHub page.
